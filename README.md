# Draft for the battle robot code

## Sharing to team

This is the code for configuring the robot. robot.py is the main robot configuration module, which uses wheel and hcsr04 (ultrasonic sensor) modules. main.py will run when the robot power is turned on and contains the intial control logic.

Main does not currently execute automatically and requires to be run with main()
